# Infrastructure

The application is designed to use GCP provided services like [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)  to run application in container and [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) databae as persistent storage layer.

## Cloud Run 

Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that lets you run containers directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure. Application building using [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) with the Google provided [CNCF-compatible Buildpacks](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/buildpacks) that build source code into container images designed to run on Google Cloud container platforms, including Cloud Run. With this tool, no need to keep and maintain application Dockerfile, all configuration can be found in [project.toml](../project.toml) file. For more Cloud Run function details check [SRE](SRE.md) aspects documentation. 

## Cloud SQL

Cloud SQL provides a cloud-based alternative to local MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server databases. SQL service is reachable from internal and external, internet-accessible IP address. The authorization possible with `Cloud SQL Auth proxy`, self-managed SSL/TLS certificate and authorized networks. Authentication method to login into database with built-in database or `IAM based` authentication.

Cloud SQL Auth proxy and Cloud SQL connector libraries for Java and Python - these provide access based on IAM, means no need to configure and store password for the application. The client identified and authorized by it' own service account. For more Cloud SQL function details check [SRE](SRE.md) aspects documentation.

## Infrastructure as Code (Iac)

[Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io) is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure.

**How do you deploy the infrastructure from this repo?**

### Pre-requisites

1. Create or get GCP project parameters
1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) version `1.1.4` and
   [Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt) version `v0.36.0` or newer.
   (You can skips this steps, if using the [devcontainer](Development.md))
1. Update the `bucket` parameter in the root `terragrunt.hcl`. We are using GCP [as a Terraform
   backend](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/gcs) to store
   Terraform state, and GSC bucket names must be globally unique. The name currently in
   the file is already taken, so you'll have to specify your own. Alternatives, you can
   set the environment variable `TG_BUCKET_PREFIX` to set a custom prefix.
1. Configure your GCP credentials using [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).
    `source ../.project.env`  
    `gcloud auth login`  
    `gcloud config set project $GCP_PROJECT_ID`  
    `gcloud auth application-default login`  
    *or use the built in script for that task: `./scripts/init-gcloud.sh`
1. Fill in your GCP Account ID's in `prod/account.hcl`

### :arrow_forward: Deploying a single module

1. `cd` into the module's folder (e.g. `cd terragrunt/prod/europe-west3/prod/database`).
1. Run `terragrunt plan` to see the changes you're about to apply.
1. If the plan looks good, run `terragrunt apply`.


### :fast_forward: Deploying all modules in a region

1. `cd` into the region folder (e.g. `cd terragrunt/prod`).
1. Run `terragrunt plan-all` to see all the changes you're about to apply.
1. If the plan looks good, run `terragrunt apply-all`.

You can done this steps also with the built-in script: `./scripts/infra-prod.sh`
